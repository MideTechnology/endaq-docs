enDAQ Python Library Documentation
==================================

Midé provides and maintains several open-source Python libraries, both general-purpose and specifically for working with enDAQ devices and data. 

``endaq``
---------
The :doc:`endaq <endaq:index>` package is a comprehensive, user-centric Python API for working with and analyzing data
recorded by `enDAQ™ devices <https://endaq.com/collections/endaq-shock-recorders-vibration-data-logger-sensors>`_.


``endaq-device``
----------------
:doc:`endaq.device <endaq-device:index>` provides a means of representing, accessing, configuring and controlling
`enDAQ™ data recorders <https://endaq.com/collections/endaq-shock-recorders-vibration-data-logger-sensors>`_. It
also supports legacy SlamStick™ devices (X, C, and S).


``idelib``
----------
:doc:`idelib <idelib:index>` is the lower-level Python API for accessing the contents of `enDAQ <https://endaq.com/>`_'s IDE recordings.
It is used by the :doc:`endaq <endaq:index>` package. The package also contains the command-line utilities ``ideexport`` and ``ideinfo``.


``ebmlite``
-----------
:doc:`ebmlite <ebmlite:index>` is a lightweight, "pure Python" library for parsing and encoding EBML (Extensible
Binary Markup Language) data. It is used extensively in enDAQ and Midé projects, including the other libraries listed here.
