enDAQ Python Library Documentation
==================================

Midé provides and maintains several open-source Python libraries, both general-purpose and specifically for working with enDAQ devices and data. 

``endaq``
---------
The :doc:``endaq`` package is a comprehensive, user-centric Python API for working with and analyzing data recorded by `enDAQ™ devices <https://endaq.com/collections/endaq-shock-recorders-vibration-data-logger-sensors>`_.


``endaq-device``
----------------
:doc:``endaq.device`` provides a means of representing, accessing, configuring and controlling
`enDAQ™ data recorders <https://endaq.com/collections/endaq-shock-recorders-vibration-data-logger-sensors>`_. It
also supports legacy SlamStick™ devices (X, C, and S).


``idelib``
----------
:doc:``idelib`` is a Python API for accessing `enDAQ <https://endaq.com/>`_'s IDE recordings. The IDE format is an `EBML <https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/ebml-specification>`_ encoded file using a custom schema. This library utilizes our `ebmlite <https://github.com/MideTechnology/ebmlite>`_ to parse the files, and provides classes that make reading data simple.
